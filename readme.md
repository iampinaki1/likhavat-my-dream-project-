This is one of my dream projects(likhavat).
I started working on it a long time ago in my local environment, and as the project kept growing and new features were added, it became difficult to manage everything locally.
Now I’m moving this project to Git for proper version control and long-term maintenance.
Currently, the project contains multiple bugs, which I will systematically fix and maintain. Along the way, I’ll keep adding essential and meaningful features.
Once all the core and sequential features are completed and the backend becomes stable, I’ll start working on the frontend.
After full deployment, I’ll continue to push updates, improvements, and optimizations regularly.
Breif about this project :
This is a social media website for writers and poets they can write books scripts they can discuss on different scripts and
different versions of it similar to github (similar and a very minimal use of version control) for now the features are completed for scripts i may add more features to books and there will be more catagories i will be adding but for now i have just added these
i have used nodemailer otp verification for user authentication
no plan to add oauth for now may be in future...
i will prioritize privacy control for users atmost
